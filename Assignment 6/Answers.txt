Assignment 6

Question 1 tea and ate would hash the same with hash1 but not 2

Question 2 It has less chance for concordance so the buckets aren't as filled

Question 3 No the count is the number of different elements and is unefffected by the hash function.

Question 4 No Table load is a function of the counts/tablesize both of which are uneffected by the hash function

Question 5 Yes if there is less concordance there is less empty buckets since elements are spread out more.

Question 6 There could be since changing the table size changes the mod of the hashing which could result in more or less concordance.

Question 7 As table size increases, the performance increases as well. The times below support this.
   TableSize = 5	Time: 91.71 seconds
   TableSize = 10	Time: 50.53 seconds
   TableSize = 15	Time: 43.93 seconds
   TableSize = 20	Time: 36.24 seconds
   TableSize = 100	Time: 4.01 seconds
   
   When the table size starts small, the chains can be very long, this can cause close to O(n) performance rates. However
   when the table size increses, the chains become shorter, moving more towards O(1).
